* Early October

* 21 days

* Similar to [last time](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dekunukem/duckypad-do-it-all-mechanical-macropad). Early bird rewards for immediately shipping.

* Rest of the rewards December / early 2025.



### Even Further

* Explore the full potential with **advanced interactive scripting**
* Read Buttons
* Write to OLED screen
* Change RGB colors
* Conditions and Loops
* Write ultra-specific macros for your exact needs

```
RGB_SET 1 128 0 255

OLED_PRINT You are in a maze
OLED_PRINT of twisty little passages

VAR $choice = $_READKEY

IF $choice == 1 THEN
    OLED_CURSOR 0 10
    OLED_PRINT It is a dead end.
    OLED_PRINT Something moves
    OLED_PRINT behind you.
END_IF

#### (OPTIONAL) Load from SD card

If app complains, you can also load from local files.

* Push the SD card inwards to pop it out

* Mount on your computer

* Select the **`entire SD card`**

### `EMUK`

Emulates a regular key.

It holds a key when you press it, and release only when you release it. Makes it behave more like a traditional keyboard.

Possible uses include push-to-talk voice chat, or WASD gamepad.

You should only use `EMUK` command **on its own**, i.e. the script should only have a single line of `EMUK` command and **nothing else**.

### `REPEAT`

Repeats the last line **`n`** times.

```
STRING Hello world
REPEAT 10
// types out "Hello world" 11 times (1 original + 10 repeats)
```

For more advanced usage, use functions and `WHILE` loops in [duckyScript 3](duckyscript3_instructions.md).

---------

Incorporating 4 years worth of feedback from the [original duckyPad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad), duckyPad Pro combines long-requested upgrades with a no-nonsense design, aiming simply to be the most capable macropad available today.

 now with **Rotary Encoders**, **Bluetooth**, **Expansion Modules**, and more!

aimed simply to be the most capable macropad, bar none.


The macros can be as simple as `Ctrl + C`, or as complex as filling forms, launching applications, or even [creating root backdoors](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/the-3-second-reverse-shell-with-a-usb-rubber-ducky) or [grabbing passwords](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/15-second-password-hack-mr-robot-style). It's all up to you!


Zoom In: `CTRL +`

Next Tab: `CTRL SHIFT TAB`
