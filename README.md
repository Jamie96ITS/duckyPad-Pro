# duckyPad Pro: Unrivaled Input Automation, 

-----------

mention expansion here

duckyPad Pro is a 20-key mechanical macropad with unrivaled input automation capability using duckyScript.

Incorporating 4 years worth of feedback from the [original duckyPad](link_here), with a deluge of new features, duckyPad Pro is designed for power users who demand sophisticated macro scripting way beyond QMK/VIA.

duckyPad Pro has all the basics:

* Hot-Swap
* Rotary Encoders
* Per-key RGB
* USB-C
* 100% **Open-source**

But also features **unlike any other**:

* Custom **[duckyScript](duckyscript_info.md)** engine, **NOT QMK/VIA**.
* Much **longer and sophisticated** macros
* Configurable **OLED** screen
* **Bluetooth** capable
* **Expansion Modules**: Up to 32 external switches.
* microSD storage
* **64 profiles**, 3712 macros total.
* [Automatic profile switching](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad-profile-autoswitcher) based on active window.
* No proprietary drivers, works out-of-box.
* Hacker friendly, tinkering guide

The macros can be as simple as `Ctrl + C`, or as complex as filling forms, launching applications, or even [creating root backdoors](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/the-3-second-reverse-shell-with-a-usb-rubber-ducky) or [grabbing passwords](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/15-second-password-hack-mr-robot-style). It's all up to you!
