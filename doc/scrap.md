Four years after the original duckyPad, I'm happy to announce **duckyPad Pro**!

	* Many small improvements (migration guide?)

this doc covers whats new, kickstarter plans, pricing, and future plans

If app complains, you can also load from local files.

* Push the SD card inwards to pop it out

* Mount on your computer

* Select the **`entire SD card`**

### `EMUK`

Emulates a regular key.

It holds a key when you press it, and release only when you release it. Makes it behave more like a traditional keyboard.

Possible uses include push-to-talk voice chat, or WASD gamepad.

You should only use `EMUK` command **on its own**, i.e. the script should only have a single line of `EMUK` command and **nothing else**.

### `REPEAT`

Repeats the last line **`n`** times.

```
STRING Hello world
REPEAT 10
// types out "Hello world" 11 times (1 original + 10 repeats)
```

For more advanced usage, use functions and `WHILE` loops in [duckyScript 3](duckyscript3_instructions.md).

Incorporating 4 years worth of feedback from the [original duckyPad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad), duckyPad Pro combines long-requested upgrades with a no-nonsense design, aiming simply to be the most capable macropad available today.

 now with **Rotary Encoders**, **Bluetooth**, **Expansion Modules**, and more!

aimed simply to be the most capable macropad, bar none.


The macros can be as simple as `Ctrl + C`, or as complex as filling forms, launching applications, or even [creating root backdoors](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/the-3-second-reverse-shell-with-a-usb-rubber-ducky) or [grabbing passwords](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/15-second-password-hack-mr-robot-style). It's all up to you!


Zoom In: `CTRL +`

Next Tab: `CTRL SHIFT TAB`
