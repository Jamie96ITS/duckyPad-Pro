When pressed, each key execute [duckyScript](duckyscript_info.md) to automate keyboard actions.

It can be as simple as shortcuts like `Control + C`, or as complex as launching applications, managing livestreams, or even [creating root backdoors](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/the-3-second-reverse-shell-with-a-usb-rubber-ducky) or [grabbing passwords](https://shop.hak5.org/blogs/usb-rubber-ducky/15-second-password-hack-mr-robot-style).
